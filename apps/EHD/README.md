# EHD

1D Elasto Hydro Dynamic simulation. This old code was part of my PhD research.

Includes also:
  * a basic skyline solver packaged in a library,
  * basic Gauss integration routines (in a library too).

## Compilation

Double click on `build_and_run.py` (requires Visual Studio 2015, cmake and python 2.x) and edit this file to make it work on your own environment.

## Notes
