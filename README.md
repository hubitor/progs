# progs

Various progs of mine:
  * `apps`: small almost-finished apps,
  * `bin`: helper scripts,
  * `cmake`: basic projects using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and other libs,
  * `docs`: misc text / markdown tests,
  * `langtests`: test of compiler and language features,
  * `metafor`: programs related to [Metafor](http://metafor.ltas.ulg.ac.be/),
  * `oldies`: old progs that should be sorted / ported to recent compilers,
  * `sandbox`: tutorials I wrote during the learning of a new language/library,
  * `skel`: skeleton of progs including CMake files,
  * `student`: my old student projects,
  * `untested`: untested pieces of code.
